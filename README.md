# word_count_project

This is a basic Django project. To understand flow of control for Django framework, this project is the best to get started with.
After installing Django, whenever you create a project it will also create a manage.py, seeting.py, urls.py files automatically by its own.
And whenever you run the server for the first time it will create db.sqlite3 file

For installing Django write the following command into your command line :
pip install Django
And if you want a specific version of Django write :
pip install django==2.2.7

For running the server write :
python manage.py runserver

Note: 
Please do not change manage.py file. You need to be too fluent with django to do that.
